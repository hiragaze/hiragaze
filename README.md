### Hey, I'm Farel 👋  
A.K.A **hiragaze** — my online nickname!

I'm a Diploma (Associate Degree) student majoring in Information Technology at Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS).

Right now, I'm still exploring things. I’m mainly into:
- Backend development (Python, FastAPI, REST APIs)
- Cybersecurity (still learning, trying out some CTFs)
- Data science basics
- Competitive Programming (OI and CPC style)

I use GitHub to learn, break things, and hopefully build something cool.
